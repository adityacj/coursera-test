		A Journaling file system is a fault-resilient file system in which data integrity is ensured because updates to directories and bitmaps are constantly written to a serial log on disk before the original disk log is updated.The basic problem to solve: random-access memory and disk usually appear to the programmer as a set of named, shared, and rewritable storage cells, called cell storage. Cell storage has semantics that are actually quite hard to make all-or-nothing, because the act of storing destroys old data, thus potentially violating the golden rule of atomicity.

	<div id = "container2">
		<p id = "p2">Beef</p>
		If the all-or-nothing action happens to have exactly one output value, then writing that value into cell storage can be the mechanism of committing, and there is no problem. Instead of a model in which a store operation overwrites old data, we instead create a new, tentative version of the data, such that the tentative version remains invisible to any reader outside this all-or-nothing action until the action commits. Whenever any action proposes to write a new value into the variable, the journal storage manager appends the prospective new value to the end of the list.

		This can be achieved by interposing a layer between client and the cell storage called the Journal Storage System. The basic idea of journal storage is straightforward: we associate with every named variable not a single cell, but a list of cells in non-volatile storage; the values in the list represent the history of the variable. Whenever any action proposes to write a new value into the variable, the journal storage manager appends the prospective new value to the end of the list. The journal storage manager appends the prospective new value to the end of the list.
